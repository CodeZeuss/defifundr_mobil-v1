## What is DefiFundr?

DefiFundr is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create and contribute to crowdfunding campaigns, and allows campaign creators to set a funding goal and deadline. If the funding goal is met before the deadline, the campaign is successful and the funds are released to the campaign creator. If the funding goal is not met before the deadline, the campaign is unsuccessful and the funds are returned to the contributors.
